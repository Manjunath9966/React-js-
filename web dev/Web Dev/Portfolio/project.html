      <h3>Title : Solar Powered IoT-Based Weather Monitoring System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Description:</h3>
            The solar-powered IoT-based weather monitoring system is an innovative and sustainable solution designed to track real-time environmental conditions using renewable energy. This system integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology with solar power to collect, transmit, and display accurate weather data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure,
            At the heart of the system are various sensors (like DHT11 for temperature and humidity, BMP180 for pressure, and LDR for light levels) connected to a microcontroller such as  ESP8266. These sensors constantly gather environmental data, which is then sent to a cloud platform like ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi. The use of a solar panel and rechargeable battery ensures the device can operate 
            continuously without external power, making it ideal for remote or off-grid locations.
